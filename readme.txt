Using Arrays

Create a program that:
1.  Prompts the user to input values for an array of five integers
2.  Displays a menu, where the user may choose
  a)  Sum - Calculates and displays the sum of numbers in the array
  b)  Mean - Calculates and displays the average of numbers in the array. Should not round.
    Should not be an integer!
  c)  Display - Displays the current values held in the array
  d)  Sequencing - Displays the difference between each adjacent set of values
    Ie if we had 3 5 2 9 0, we would get the output
    2 -3 7 -9
    This just needs to be printed, not saved
  e)  Search - Indicate whether the user’s chosen value is contained in the array, or not (boolean result should be returned, ie function).
  f)  Edit - The user is re-prompted for input into the array (all elements)
  g)  Exit - terminate the program
3.  Loop back to step 2
There should be at least 4 functions used in this program

You should probably use a global const int for array size. Do not use global variables unless they’re constants!

Points:
1 - Documentation, readability, format
2 - Proper use of functions
3 - Proper program flow (conditionals, loops, etc)
2 - Filename and Header
2 - Output testing
